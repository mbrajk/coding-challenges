## Find number of occurrences of string in another string

Solution Language: C#

Given a search parameter and the text to search, find the maximum number of occurrences of
the search parameter in the text to be searched. The characters do not need to be in order in the text. 
Each character in the text can be used only once.

This solution generalizes the original problem which was to only search for 1 word in a given string.

Additionally this solution is utilizing LINQ and Dictionary data structures to process the data.
