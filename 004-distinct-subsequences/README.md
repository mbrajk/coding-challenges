## Distinct Subsequences

---

**Solution Language: C#**

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return the number of distinct subsequences of `s` which equals `t`.

Characters can be removed to create additional subsequences but order cannot be altered.

This implementation does not pass leetcode's speed/performance requirements but does give valid answers.

Quicker solution will require some form of dynamic programming to speed up the checks.
